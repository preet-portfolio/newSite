# Crafting Ottawa Bites Website with Next.js and Tailwind CSS

At Ottawa Bites, we wanted to create a modern and visually appealing website that would showcase our food and services. After considering various options, we decided to use Next.js and Tailwind CSS for our frontend development. In this post, I'll walk you through the process of building our website and show you how Heroicons helped us save time and streamline our development process.

## Why Next.js and Tailwind CSS?

Next.js is a React-based framework that allows us to create server-side rendered applications with ease. It provides a great developer experience and allows us to build fast and scalable web applications. On the other hand, Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows us to write less CSS and build responsive and customizable user interfaces.

Together, Next.js and Tailwind CSS provide a powerful combination that allows us to build modern and performant web applications with ease.

## Setting Up Our Project

To get started, we created a new Next.js project and installed Tailwind CSS. We then created a custom configuration file for Tailwind CSS and added our brand colors and typography.

Next, we set up our pages and components using the Next.js file system routing. We created reusable components that we could use across our website and implemented responsive design using Tailwind CSS classes.

## Using Heroicons

One of the challenges we faced was finding suitable icons for our website. We wanted to use icons that were modern, visually appealing, and easy to use. That's when we discovered Heroicons.

Heroicons is a set of free SVG icons that are easy to use and customizable. We were able to find the perfect icons for our website and integrate them into our components with ease. Heroicons saved us a lot of time and helped us streamline our frontend development process.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, using Next.js and Tailwind CSS allowed us to build a modern and visually appealing website for Ottawa Bites. We were able to create reusable components, implement responsive design, and integrate Heroicons seamlessly into our website. If you're looking to build a modern and performant web application, I highly recommend using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
